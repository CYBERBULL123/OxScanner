## Usage üìñ

The intuitive interface of OxScanner allows for easy navigation and execution of various network security operations.

### Example Commands:

- **ARP Poisoning**: Input the client MAC address and gateway IP to initiate an ARP poisoning attack.
- **IKE Scanning**: Enter the target IP address to scan for IKE vulnerabilities.

Each section of the app includes step-by-step instructions, helping you execute network security tasks effortlessly.


### Wireless Sniffing and Testing:

For wireless testing, make sure your wireless interface (e.g., `wlan0`) is set to monitor mode. Use the following commands to enable monitor mode on a wireless interface:
```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```
Once the interface is in monitor mode, you can capture wireless traffic and perform various wireless security operations.
